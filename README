This is a tool with the central purpose of debugging and exploring the loaded classes in a JVM. 

The intention of this code is to be open source. The point is to learn more about reverse engineering.

The intended feature set includes:

* Hierarchy Tree View
    * Editable (Insert/Remove/Move) 

* Real Time Value Debugging
    * Value watches
    * Threshold values (alert)
    * On screen debugging allowed

* Object Explorer
    * Stems from RTD
    * Explores any non-array object
    * No limit on depth

* Array Explorer (for any size dimension)
    * Provides RTD access to object explorer for arrays
    * Should be able to filter subsets in array

* Member Identification Utility
    * Easy to use / clean framework
    * Standard format (I/O both) [CSV likely]
    * Work in-line with RTD for debugging (refactor)
    * Output Support

* Real Time Injection (note: able to be hot-swapped with changes)
    * For use in conjunction with MIU
    * Keep initial classes, hot-swap when needed

* Member Transform Support
    * Would be for callback / deob
    * Not essential for the initial purpose
